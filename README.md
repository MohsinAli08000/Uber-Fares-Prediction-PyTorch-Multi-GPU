# Uber-Fares-Prediction-PyTorch-Multi-GPU
This project aims to predict the fare of Uber rides based on various factors such as pickup location, dropoff location, distance, time of day, and weather conditions. Using machine learning models, the project analyzes historical ride data to provide accurate fare estimates. The model can be used for understanding pricing patterns and optimizing Uber's fare structure. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, with a focus on achieving high prediction accuracy.
